# Control Basics
## Feedback control: PID
For most engineers, their first and possible only exposure to control theory is the PID controller and its subsets:

This basic control algorithm accepts a desired value for some plant state, and using the measured error in that state generates an output to the plant. The three components of a PID loop are:
- Proportional: This components is simply a gain, kP, multiplied by the error. Generally, the P term will do the majority of the "heavy lifting".
- Integral: This component sums the error over time multiplied by a gain kI. The I term is generally used in situations where there is significant steady state error to push the system closer to 0 error. Care must be taken to prevent the I term from increasing too much, called "integral windup", if the plant stops responding to controller output.
- Derivative: This component takes the change in error over time and multiplies it by a gain kD. The D term is generally used to prevent overshoot, when the inertia of the plant causes the process variable to pass the command setpoint. Since the derivative is typically very small compared to the other terms, kD is usually relatively high, so care must be taken to prevent this term from causing dynamic instability if the plant encounters an undesirable harmonic or other situation causing large changes in output.
Not all systems require all three components. Simple systems with minimal friction and fairly linear dynamics, for example a flywheel being spun by a DC motor, can often be controlled with a simple P controller. For similar systems with non-negligible friction, PI controllers can be used to eliminate steady state error. In systems with significant overshoot and/or high inertia but minimal friction, a PD controller may be appropriate.
A PID controller and all of its variants are considered "feedback" control. They measure the process variable and feed it back into the controller, allowing for very low errors. The downside to pure feedback controllers is that they are only reactive; no output can be generated to change the state of the plant until a non-zero error is encountered by changing the command setpoint. If the setpoint is simply changed from one quasi-static value to another, or if the setpoint is constantly changing but at a slow rate compared to the response time of the system, acceptable response can usually be obtained purely from feedback. However, in situations where the command setpoint is varying quickly with respect to the system response time, feedback control alone may not produce acceptable tracking. In these situations, feedforward control can help improve response.
## Feedforward control: The Basics
Feedforward control allows control system designers to use knowledge of the dynamics of a system to anticipate changes in the setpoint and proactively produce outputs to drive the plant to the desired state.
